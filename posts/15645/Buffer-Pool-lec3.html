<h3>Buffer Pool</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Talking about the disk manager (the lowest layer of the setup)</p>
<p>The primary storage that that the database is assumed to be on the
disk (non-volatile). Non volatile means that if you pull the plug the
data will still be there. S3 is object storage. Network storage is the
slowest. The better ones are cpu caches and the other things. Persistent
memory from intel was faster than SSD but it did not go ahead. Access
times – L1 cache reference is like 1ns, L2 is like 4ns, SSD, 16,000 ns,
2 million ns for HDD</p>
<p>Random access is memory that you can do random access at any place
and ask for the pointer to that memory. But for the hard disk a
sequential memory access is much better as the hard drive is physical
and sequential is much better.</p>
<p>System design goals are to minimize disk access, make it sequential
and hanlde cases when the RAM is not big enough for the memory (use
virtual memory or soemting)</p>
<p>The disk pushes the page to the memory (buffer pool) and then the
pointer to that page from the memory is given to the execution engine,
changes are made on the RAM and then the copy is written back to the
system</p>

Problem 2</b>: How to efficiently move files on the disk to Bpool</p>

<h3>Storage manager</h3>
<p>The OS does not understand the memory in the disk that the storage
manager understands, only the storage manager understand the data
written here.</p>
<p>Organizes the data in the form of pages on the disk. Each page has a
pageid and the pages are self contained, there is a layer that maps the
pageid to the physical locations in the dsik</p>
<p>The page is the largest block of data that can be written
atomically(all bytes are written or none) (there are failsafe writes).
For constant, writes and updates, a smaller page is better coz then we
have to transfer less to memory again and again.</p>
<p>Different databases manage pages differently. Most common is heap
file organization. Hashing file organization is also there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sqlite is a sigle filesystem and postgres uses multiple files</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The file contains multiple pages and the dbms maintains special pages
that tracks the location of the page within the file system. One entry
pper database object in the directory (like one for each table) Must
make sure that the directory pages are in sync with the data pages The
directory page also needs to be persistent and should not die.</p>
<p><b>Self containment</b></p>
<p>How do we store tuples in a page, use the slotted pages architecture.
Each tuple is prefixed with aheader that contains met-ata about it (the
order that you use for the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> is the exact order
in which it is actually stored. (sometimes it is better to change it but
they do not reorder))</p>
<p>For engineering reasons they specify them in the same order than
something else. There us a way to pre-join the tuples that will be
joined most frequently (called a physical denormalization) that allows
for mroe efficient I/O since both of them are usually joined when the
updates are being made However, it can makes updates more expensive</p>
<p>postgres has something called the ctid that gives you the offset of
the tuple!. (deletion will nto change the tuple ids evenif it could
become more efficient ) There is something called the vacuum that does
garbage collection and then the tuple ids become more optimized.</p>
<p>(sometimes when you are inserting the tuple, they will reuse the open
slots (in SQL server i think))</p>
<p>Database made of files – files contain pages,(organized differently)
and the pages contain the tuples (in different ways)</p>
