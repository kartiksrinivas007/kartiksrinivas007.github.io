<h4>Storage models and data compression</h4>
<p>The 3 key categories of workloads</p>
<ul>
<li>OLTP (online transaction processing) - queries touch only some
records</li>
<li>OLAP (online analytical processing) - jim gray - heavy workloads
and read-heavy (large amounts of data) - heavy joins and more</li>
<li>Hybrid transactions + analytical processing (you wont both of
them then it is called HTAP)</li>
<li>Massive amount of data (big database) - used to mine fo rapterns
to improve the operational efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>(OLTP systems want everything in a single place), OLAP we need a
diametrically opposite storage system though - everybody wants HTAP and
the answers are not obvious (talk offline with him)</p>
<p>Physical data independence and the other data independence
(logical)</p>
<p>Logical and you can define a view on top of that and then only expose
the view to the user. (security) the LSM/heap file are examples of
physical data independence (same SQL query different storage model)</p>
<p>In NSM the bitmap index is present in the header for every tuple in
the slotted page Remember that there is a page directory. We go from the
query to the index on that which then points me to the page and then I
take that page into memory (if I have an index) – otherwise just bring
all the pages into the memory I can look into the page directory to ask
if there is space to add into a page or not.</p>
<p>Column stores the decomposition storage model (fixed length value per
attribute ( all elements of a column are of equal length)) - have
different pages for each column (storage ideas).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can I switch the database storage style on the fly? – storage systems
like S3 really like this, there is sometimes software on disk that might
change how the data is stored so that the queries become efficient
(hybrid data-storage models)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>can do offset calculations</li>
<li>you can also do variable length stuff (use pointers to point to the
other rows and stuff)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>slow for point queries, inserts updates and deletes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Middle ground</p>
<p>PAX (partition attributes across) Within a row group, store them
column wise.</p>

<section class="level4" id="dictionary-compression">
<h4>Dictionary compression</h4>
<ul>
<li>Need lossless compression</li>
<li>block level compression</li>
<li>tuple level (done in NSM type storage)</li>
</ul>
<p>Compression techniques - LZO, LZ4, Snappy etc - Zstd (internal
dictionary compression, huffman decoding etc)</p>
<ul>
<li>The mod log is common (the mod log is changes recorded and the
compressed page is a value of th mode log (INNODB compression))</li>
<li>you want the database to operate on compressed data (ideally) -
the database does ths internally sometimes.</li>
<li>Column stores have 2 big things – they are efficient with memory
(no garbage though), they are also very good with compression (vey
superior). (more likely that you find similar attribute values making
compression much better in DSM)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="level4" id="rle">
<h4>RLE</h4>
<p>Run length encoding (same value will turn up more often). (database
compression of one type) (sorting gives the best but you cannot sort the
other columns as well) count * froup by very good with this encoding</p>
<p>Pick the most important column (you are ready to change the layout) –
works in this case very well</p>
<p>Bit Packing (parquet uses it a lot)</p>
<p>Reduce the number of bits for each value dependent on the value
itself. (use bit shifting tricks to operate on multiple values in a
single word)</p>
<p>Bit packing sucks when there is a single outlier thats a problem (too
big and the bits are used) - then store that member separately (offset
and the value)</p>
<p>Bitmap indexing You maintain the state of whether the element is
present or not. (works when the domain of the column values is small
(not too many different ones)) - 2 is the size then only 2* 8 + (bits
take how much size) type of space. Sometimes the bitmaps can also be
compressed</p>
<p>Roaring bitmaps (storing the bitmaps efficiently)</p>
<p>Delta encoding (you stroe the difference in the values since the
values barely change as we move from row to row) - then on top of that
you can run RLE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>different columns have different encoding techniques depending on the
situation. IO is the bottleneck, that is where you need to save time!
corruptions (we maintain a checksum) the header is also compressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Dictionary compression</h2>
<p>each string is given a code (huffman coding source coding). parquet
could have one dictionary group for each</p>
