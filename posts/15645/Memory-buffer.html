<h3>Buffer Pool</h3>
<p>Execution engine gets shared pointers to a page in the buffer pool
buffer pool is just an array in memory of frames (the buffer pools can
be nearly 1TB in size)</p>
<p>Modified pages are called dirty and they are not immediately written
and there is a page table that keeps track of what pages are in memory.
Pin counter is to prevent the pages from being moved to diff frames so
that the pointer from the page tale does not become invalid The page
table contains the page and is a hash table that supports <span class="math display">\[O(1)\]</span> lookups of whether the page is in
memory or not and whether it is dirty or not etc.</p>
<p>There is other stuff in memory called log buffers etc sometimes
machine learning algorithms are used in this to predict levels of memory
needed.</p>
<p>latches used to protect th page table in th assignment</p>
<p>Caching pages common in os and there is a mech called
<code>mmap</code> that uses virtual memory and there will be a map from
disk onto the virtual memory (even 1TB). The OS has a buffer pool that
pulls the page onto physical memory Why not let the OS do this stuff? â€“
the transactions need to wait for the operating system to run the
eviction policy and it takes too much time. Thread will get
suspended</p>
<p>The DBMS would not know what is in physical memory and multiple
threads would be stalled. The OS can flush the pages at any time even if
it is a dirty page.</p>
<p>The least recently used is expensive since on every page access I
need to update the newest page</p>
<p>Use the Clock replacement algorithm, each page has a reference bit
and the pages are oriented in a circle. On access to a page set
reference bit to 1. For eviction keep rotating and setting ref bits to
one until you get a ref bit set.</p>
<p>Often the pages are run-time compile optimizations to the buffer
pool. A better algorithm than LRU is to keep track of the page that is
taken once per hour and the other one is once per day then clearly the
one to keep in memory is the once per hour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combining clock and the lRUK is interesting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Postgres assigns a limited number of buffer bool pages to a query and
uses it as a circular ring buffer Based on the file organization and the
pointers you can optimize the page calls into the buffer (indexes and
pointers from one page to the other)</p>
<p>There is a background BP worker thread and sees page 2 that is dirty
and either writes and sets undirty flag or evicts the page onto the
disk.</p>
<p>Disk IO is the one that optimizes the writes. Most DBMS bypass the OS
cache (so that the cache memory does not take the same page back that is
in the bufferpool) The buffer pool uses <code>O_direct</code> to bypass
the OS in that sense</p>
<p><code>fsync</code> called a massive amount of pain since the USB once
removed the pages were marked undirty but nothing is actually written
since the usb was just removed and the OS did not tell the dbms that
that the stuff was not there.</p>
<p>There are approaches where there are multiple buffer pools. You can
join two queries together to read the same stuff on the disk pages so
that they both access the same pages instead of different ones.</p>
