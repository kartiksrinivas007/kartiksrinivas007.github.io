<h2>Apple parking lot</h2>
<p>Instead of <code>pthread_mutex</code> and the other things, apple
gives WTF::lock, which is much harder</p>
<p>STL implementations may be a little slower on some different
hardware, people write their own</p>
<p>Using spin loops that the OS guy do not want you to use</p>
<p>Spin locks are things where the thread keeps spinning, and doe snot
go to sleep while waiting</p>
<p>(helps because context switching is expensive)</p>
<p>Compare and swap is an example, where a mutex is given and</p>
<p><code>__sync_bool_and_compare(&amp;M, 20, 30);</code></p>
<p>(this instruction will swap if and only if it is 20, if it is equal
it will wait/ go the other way)</p>
<p>This is an atomic instruction that must happen at the same time</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="approach-2">
<h2>Approach # 2</h2>
<p>It is to use an OS mutex (and this is kernel based) Userspace Latch
(can the userspace latch resolve it over there)</p>
<p>spin and wait in the userspace, an then grab the OS latch.</p>
<p><code>m.lock()</code> we go and grab the OS’s latch (portable
solution and not fast)</p>
<section class="level3" id="approach-3-reader-writer-latches">
<h3>Approach #3 Reader-Writer Latches</h3>
<p>pthread mutex and the conditional variable is there internally that
is used to prevent starvation of the read or write type of system</p>
<p>Internally contains a read lock and a write lock</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="hash-table-latching">
<h3>Hash table latching</h3>
<p>For open addressing (hash tables) Hash table is made up of a bunch of
pages and then you hash into it and then you make your way down as you
go forward.</p>
<p>Hold the latch on the root as little as possible AS LITTLE AS
POSSIBLE, release whenever you do not need it, and do it all at
once.</p>
<p>In the worst case, what nodes will you touch? do you need the
parent’s latch</p>
<p>The reads only go down so they are fine</p>
<p>Read latches take the forward and the child and then after going
below, release parent and then try gaining your child, then go down? (to
save the integrity of the traversal pointer)</p>
<p>allocate on the right during the insertion</p>
<p>Inserts and deletes are latching on the roots (google 5 billion tps)
– latch for as little as possible</p>
<p>Recognition structures the odds that I do an insert and delete and
other stuff is going to be very little.</p>
<p>Range Searches</p>
<p>Lock couple your way down and lock couple your way wile going forward
also</p>
<p>Protect the root_page_id, it is important!! Protect the pointer that
points to the root</p>
