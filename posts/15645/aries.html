<h3>ARIES</h3>
<p>This post is a short summary of the ARIES recovery algorithm with
Fuzzy checkpoints, most of the explanations on this algorithm are
tedious and hard to understand with a lot of notation, so I am
summarizing it in a short and sweet way here</p>
<p>Objective: Retrieve Database state after a crash. Desired State has
the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A committed transaction needs to be durable</li>
<li>An aborted transaction needs all its changes undone</li>
<li>A transaction that was running needs to be aborted on crash</li>
</ul>
<p>You must be wondering why 1 and 2 are even needed. That is because of
‘STEAL + NO FORCE’ policy, where we give total freedom to the Buffer
pool to evict any page whenever it wants at whatever time (for the
purpose of a higher throughput) So even a commit or an abort does not
mean that pages are written/removed from disk.</p>
<p>Okay, so when are we safe to flush changes of a dirty page to
disk?</p>
<p>Of course when the log of the change has already been written (if
this did not happen, then it would be impossible to recover from a
change that was just flushed to disk). When you see a transaction
commit, all the changes(logs) associated with that transaction are
flushed to disk.</p>
<p>So it makes sense to keep track of the latest log that has been
written to disk for a particular page. That is denoted as
<code>pageLSN</code>.<br/>
Where is the Log of the latest flushed change/log to any page? That is
denoted as <code>flushedLSN</code>. What is the earliest un-recorded
change to a disk to a page in memory (the earliest change that has not
been recorded on disk)? That is called <code>recLSN</code>.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="analysis-phase">
<h3>Analysis Phase</h3>
<p>The goal of this phase is to determine:</p>
<p>Which transactions were active at the time of the crash (to later
undo them), Which pages in memory were dirty (so we know which ones need
to be redone), The most recent checkpoint.</p>
<p>Starting from the last fuzzy checkpoint, we scan forward in the log,
updating information like the Transaction Table and Dirty Page Table. At
the end of this phase, we know the state of the system just before the
crash, i.e. we now now what pages may be dirty and what transactions
need to be undone/redone</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="redo-phase">
<h3>Redo Phase</h3>
<p>We redo only changes only for committed transactions. Here, we replay
log records to ensure that all effects of committed transactions are
reflected in the database. But we don’t start from the beginning of the
log—we start from the smallest recLSN in the Dirty Page Table (since
that is the earliest un-recorded change to a page that is dirty and
might need to be redone) For every log record after that, we only redo
it if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The page it affects is dirty, and</li>
<li>The LSN of the log record ≥ the page’s pageLSN (i.e. this change has
not already been flushed to disk)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is efficient because we skip unnecessary replays and only
reapply the changes that might not have made it to disk before the
crash.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="undo-phase">
<h3>Undo Phase</h3>
<p>We undo changes for uncommitted or aborted transactions. Using the
Transaction Table and the log’s backward chaining via prevLSN, we
generate Compensation Log Records (CLRs) as we roll back each change.
These CLRs are important for supporting idempotent recovery—if there’s a
crash during recovery, we can just redo the CLRs safely.</p>
