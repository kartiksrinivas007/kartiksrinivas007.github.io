<h3>Pages and Storage</h3>
<p>the DBMS assigns a logical tuple a unique record identifier per
record . File ID, Page id and then the slot number together gives you
the unique identification sqlite uses the rowid as the primary key and
uses that as a hidden key</p>
<p>Slotted pages has a continguous memory requirement after delete and
things might need to be shifted.</p>
<p><code>ctid</code> in postgres is the internal record id – made during
the creation of the table. (postgres) The ctid has 0,3,5,7,9 when the
ctid is not stord vaccumed and changed. Postgres does it lazily The
vacuum needs to lock the page otherwise the other process that is trying
to make a read query is going to be problematic.</p>
<p>Updating these record id’s is tiring (MVCC and concurrent
accesses).</p>
<p>weaknesses of tuple oriented pages is that the storage not fully used
and then the entire page needs to be brought into memory for even
chanign aisngle tuple. Worst case scenario when updating multiple tuples
that are on different pages</p>
<p>(HDFS, Google Collosus - S3) (in the cloud you get an S3-bucket
instead of a page and you cannot change it otherwise (immutable)), so
the block structured file system has become more prevalent.</p>
<p>Moved from Spinning disk to SSD’s. You can no longer write to that
via disks</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="log-structured-storage">
<h3>Log structured storage</h3>
<p>There is a key that the log structured file system maintains. The
primary key if present is used as the key for that tuple (the value is
the full tuple), if no tpkey then lets make a hidden key again Each log
entry has a <code>PUT/DELETE</code> operation.</p>
<p>Memtable (in memory – organized as a skip list based on the key or
something – based on the key quickly find the record for some key). PUTs
consecutively update the same key.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within each SSTable the keys are sorted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last layer is stored in an SSTable and the SSTable is sorted in the
keys from low to high. Level #0 is the SSTable and after the changes are
made, it is flushed to disk</p>
<p>Since there maybe multiple SSTables, the SSTables are next to each
other from newest to oldest. Since the same key could be in 2 different
SSTables, then to find the next level I can jsur merge the 2 SSTables
together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Better merging algorithms for SSTables is interesting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latest copy is always going to be higher up (the first encounter
in the levels is the oldest since every level is sorted in the
SSTables)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expensive to see if a key exists</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Idea is to maintain a bloom filter or min max to keep track of
whether the key exists, Deletion you make a tombstone that flows below
and then you can tell whether the thing exists or not</p>
<p>Log structured storage is very common now. (Cassandra is coming next
class for talk) Compaction is expensive when the SSTables are growing
too large on a level. &gt; After merging the original SSTables are
deleted</p>
<p>B + trees plays maintainenace cost front and the other ones like
lSM’s pay for it later (when levels build up)</p>
<p>The index storage has a B-Tree for all of the pages and the record is
the value of an index. (do not know exactly how it is organzed)</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="tuple-storage">
<h3>Tuple storage</h3>
<p>Compact it and so that there is no misaligned calls to the system to
load the memory. (makes it easier, add zeroes so that it becomes
cleaner)</p>
<p>Fixed precision arithmetic and more things are also there, that
prevent arithmetic errors (financial – audits). The numeric types are to
be dealt with as well. (internally stores a struct for the math behind
the picture)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Representing big things (big strings) and you use prefixes to
evaluate there is a blob type that stores a pdf or something like that -
oracle bfile data type micrsooft has a filestream datatype</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SQLite is a DBMS (knows consistency better – has a buffer pool), so
they literally use DBMS instead of a file system lollll</p>

<section class="level3" id="system-catalogs-and-more-are-also-there">
<h3>System catalogs and more are also there</h3>
<p>Select typename, typelen from pg_type (to see the number if bytes it
takes) Information schema is where the stats are stored mostly</p>
