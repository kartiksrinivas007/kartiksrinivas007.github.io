<h1>CMU Machine Learning Course Reviews</h1>
<p>This is an ongoing review of some of the courses I am taking at CMU.
The courses are rated on a scale of 5 for (lectures, exams)</p>
<section class="level2" id="intermediate-statistics-larry-wasserman">
<h2>36-705: Intermediate Statistics (Larry Wasserman)</h2>
<p>Rating: 4.8/5</p>
<p>Counterpart: 36700<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sidenote-1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sidenote-1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I did not take this course but according to what I’ve
heard the teaching faculty take this course. My batchmates took it and
complained about the poor-teaching and lack of depth. You end up doing
the same assignment problems as 36-705, only that your course lags 2
weeks behind.</span></p>
<p>In short: Talk about getting a chance to learn from a legend in the
field.</p>
<p>Lectures: (5/5) Structured remarkably well, perfectly done lectures.
It’s like going to watch a movie . Taking notes is not necessary since
nearly every idea he discusses is also present in his meticulously well
written notes. Gives you a deep understanding of statistics . Every
sentence he utters is a foundational idea behind some subfield in
statistics. This is a wonderful course to take to get an idea of what
statistics is really all about, and sharpen your ability in ML
theory.</p>
<p>Difficulty: (3/5) For anyone coming from a slightly mathematical
background or from a top college in India, this course is not hard at
all. The assignments are easy, good and teach you a lot.</p>
<p>Grading: (3/5) The course grades absolutely (there is no curve). This
makes it harder to get an A+. For context, I scored a 99.5/100 on the
final and still landed an A.</p>

<section class="level2" id="advanced-introduction-to-machine-learning-nihar-shah">
<h2>10-715: Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning (Nihar Shah)</h2>
<p>Rating: 2/5</p>
<p>Counterpart: 10-701 (Standard Introduction to Machine Learning)<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sidenote-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sidenote-2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This course is wonderful, Matt Gormley makes detailed
slides, well formed homework assignments and the exams are well-timed
and test your understanding of the topics taught.</span>.</p>
<p>In short: Poorly structured course, no depth, no rigor. Exams are
poorly framed and speed-based. The only saving grace is the homeworks,
that are wonderfully made.</p>
<p>Lectures(1/5): No slides, he writes lots of text on the board. Time
is wasted. The course notes are <em>horrendous</em> for the second
section of the course. The material keeps changing every year since new
and more trendy topics are trying to be covered. Although I support
evolving courses, the material should be planned better, and there
should be atleast some intuition developed.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sidenote-3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sidenote-3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">He tried covering TRPO and PPO in the second lecture of
reinforcement learning. He told us it would come on the exam. Most
people studied hard learning from UC berkeley/Stanford material to only
realize that he was lying. The same thing was done with Probabilstic
Graphical models where most people studied from Ermon’s Blog.</span></p>
<p>Homeworks(5/5): Saving grace of this course. Well framed homeworks
with good starter code, and these also teach you something good about ML
implementation and differences with theory. The homeworks are made by
the TA’s</p>
<p>Exams (0/5): The instructor frames each question like an essay in an
attempt to make it look like a complicated examination. (Often using
poor notation as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">red herring</a>) The
question in reality is remarkably simple but framed in a way that takes
a normal brain 15 minutes to understand<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sidenote-4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sidenote-4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">To give an example of his notation :-Consider the set
<span class="math inline">\(S = \{u | \exists  v \in V  \text{ such that
embedding of } v = u \}\)</span>. See what I mean? He could have just
said <span class="math inline">\(S =   \{ \text{ set of embeddings of }
v \in V  \}\)</span></span>. To
make things worse, the exam is short – implying that you have to select
questions to attempt. To make things even worse – simple questions have
high scores (10 marks for a simple question) and hard questions might
only give you 4 marks. This means that if you end up missing a simple
question (your grade goes down the drain, since many others got it
right)<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sidenote-5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sidenote-5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">My opinion is not biased by the grade, I got a (56/60)
on the final.</span></p>
<p>Grading(2/5): Curved. He doesn’t care about your GPA, he claims the
course is all about “learning”, even though no deep learning<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sidenote-6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sidenote-6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Yes that was pun intended.</span> was actually given</p>
