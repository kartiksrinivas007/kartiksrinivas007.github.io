### 36-705: Intermediate Statistics (Larry Wasserman)
Rating: 4.8/5

Counterpart: 36700[^reviewstats]

In short: Talk about getting a chance to learn from a legend in the field.

Lectures: (5/5) Structured remarkably well, perfectly done lectures. It's like going to watch a movie . Taking notes is not necessary since nearly every idea he discusses is also present in his meticulously well written notes. Gives you a deep understanding of statistics . Every sentence he utters is a foundational idea behind some subfield in statistics. This is a wonderful course to take to get an idea of what statistics is really all about, and sharpen your ability in ML theory.


Difficulty: (3/5)
For anyone coming from a slightly mathematical background or from a top college in India, this course is not hard at all.
The assignments are easy, good and teach you a lot.

Grading: (3/5)
The course grades absolutely (there is no curve). This makes it harder to get an A+. For context, I  scored a 99.5/100 on the final and still landed an A.


### 10-715: Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning
Rating: 2/5

Counterpart: 10-701 (Standard Introduction to Machine Learning)[^review].

In short: Poorly structured course, no depth, no rigor. Exams are poorly framed and speed-based. The only saving grace is the homeworks, that are wonderfully made.


Lectures(1/5): No slides, he writes lots of text on the board. The course notes are _horrendous_ for the second section of the course because the material keeps changing every year since new and more trendy topics are trying to be covered. Although I support evolving courses, the material should be planned better.[^example]

Homeworks(5/5): Saving grace of this course. Well framed homeworks with good starter code, and these also teach you something good about ML implementation and differences with theory. The homeworks are made by the TA's 

Exams (0/5): The exam is short -- speed based, implying that you have to select questions to attempt. To make things even worse -- simple questions have high scores (10 marks for a simple question) and hard questions might only give you 4 marks. This means that if you end up missing a simple question (your grade goes down the drain, since many others got it right)[^grade]

Grading(2/5): Curved. 

[^lol]: Yes that was pun intended.

[^grade]: My opinion is not biased by the grade, I got a (56/60) on the final.

[^review]: This course is wonderful, Matt Gormley makes detailed slides, well formed homework assignments and the exams are well-timed and test your understanding of the topics taught. 

[^example]: Covering Message passing, TRPO, PPO in 2 lectures and then lying about it coming on the final is not a fun self-study experience.

[^ex2]: To give an example of his notation :-Consider the set $S = \{u | \exists  v \in V  \text{ such that embedding of } v = u \}$. See what I mean? He could have just said $S =   \{ \text{ set of embeddings of } v \in V  \}$

[^reviewstats]: I did not take this course but according to what I've heard the teaching faculty take this course. My batchmates took it and complained about the poor-teaching and lack of depth. You end up doing the same assignment problems as 36-705, only that your course lags 2 weeks behind. -->
